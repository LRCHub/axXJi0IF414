[Verse 1]
London I love you but you're bringing me down
In that special way that only you know how
So I'll come and I'll go
I'll to and I'll fro
And pledge allegiance
Pledge allegiance to another town
[Chorus]
You give me an asthma attack
Still you keep me keep me coming back
Must have a taste for the flouride
No other place that this city's like
(Repeat)
[Verse 2]
London I love you but I'm so confused
What part of me belongs to you
So I mix the blue with the gold
To make a colour so bold
All the different shades
All the different shades
Of a lost soul
[Chorus]
You give me an asthma attack
Still you keep me keep me coming back
Must have a taste for the flouride
No other place that this city's like
(Repeat)
Oh London I'll never forget you
You were the one I lost my two front teeth too
The first one that I lost my heart too
So how could I ever forget you
(Repeat)
[Chorus]
You give me an asthma attack
Still you keep me keep me coming back
Must have a taste for the flouride
No other place that this city's like
(Repeat 3x)
